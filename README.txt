The screen resolution for the UI is seemingly broken for the build version, atleast on my end.
I tried for hours to fix it, but it never really got any better, so but everything looks fine within the Unity editor, so my Demo will be played there.

All non-solid textures and decals were made by myself using ASEPRITE. 
(The Dash Panel texture was modeled off the Mario Kart 64 Dash Panel Design)
